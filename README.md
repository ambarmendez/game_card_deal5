## Card Game

Write a console program that deals with playing cards

-------------------------------------------------------

There must be a Card class

Each card has a name, a suit and a points value

for example:

Jack      Hearts    10

7           Spades      7

-------------------------------------------------------

The menu should look something like this:

1. Create New Deck
2. Shuffle Deck
3. Deal New Hand
4. Display Hand Total Points
5. Exit

-------------------------------------------------------

The program must have a 'deck' (Deck Class) which is a list of all 52 cards in a deck of playing cards (this must use either an array or list)

The program should randomise (shuffle) the order of cards in the deck. this should be accomplished by calling the "Shuffle" method on the deck instance.

The program should be able to deal 5 cards to a 'Hand' (another class containing an array or list of cards)

The Hand class should have a "PointsValue()" method to return the total points value of the cards in the hand.

The program should display the total points value of the cards in the hand-generated by calling the PointsValue() method.

When exiting the program, the current hand of five cards ( if a current hand exists ) should be able to be saved to a CSV file, and if there is a hand saved to the file it should be loaded from the file when the program is launched.
